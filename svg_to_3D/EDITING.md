# Editing this page

You can edit all project copy and section order without changing `index.html`.
The page reads these files on load; text/layout edits require no build command.

| File | What to edit |
| --- | --- |
| `content/introduction.md` | Main title and project description. |
| `content/notes.md` | Notes title and body. |
| `page.json` | Section order, layout styles, author/date, browser title, and header/footer. |
| `scenes.json` | Each viewer pair: IDs, titles, prompts, labels, SVG/layer paths, and videos. |
| `styles.css` | Appearance and animation styles. |
| `app.js` | Page rendering and viewer behavior. |
| `theme.js` | Saved theme, applied before the first paint. |

## Writing text

The first Markdown heading becomes the section title. Everything below it is
rendered as the body. For example, `content/introduction.md` can contain:

```markdown
# Lifting SVGs to *3D*

Write your project description here. Use **bold**, *italic*, and
[links](https://example.com) when needed.

- A first point
- A second point
```

Headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, code, blockquotes, and tables work.
Image and link paths are relative to the Markdown file; for example, an image
in `assets/` is `![Caption](../assets/image.jpg)` from `content/notes.md`.
A link starting with `#` refers to a section on this page.

## Writing LaTeX equations

All Markdown sections support MathJax equations. No HTML or build command is
needed. Use `\( ... \)` for inline math, and `\[ ... \]` for centered display
equations. `$ ... $` (inline) and `$$ ... $$` (display) also work. Put display
delimiters on their own lines with a blank line before and after the block.

```markdown
The observed curve is \(c(t)\in\mathbb R^2\).

\[
\begin{aligned}
c(t) &= \pi_\theta(C(t)) + \delta(t) \\
\delta(t) &= 0
\end{aligned}
\]
```

In multiline equations, `&` marks the alignment point and `\\` starts the
next row. `aligned`, `cases`, matrices, fractions, sums, Greek letters and
`\boxed{...}` are supported. Standard display environments such as
`\begin{align*} ... \end{align*}` can also appear without delimiters.
Equations that are wider than a mobile screen scroll within their own block.

Use Markdown `**bold**` and `-` lists for prose instead of LaTeX `\textbf`
or `itemize`. MathJax renders mathematical expressions, not full LaTeX
documents. Inside code spans or fenced code blocks, equations stay literal.
Escape ordinary dollar signs as `\$`, or use the unambiguous `\( ... \)`
syntax when writing about prices.

Equations can also be written directly in HTML inside `<main>` using the
same delimiters. `math.js` protects TeX from Markdown parsing and configures
the locally hosted MathJax 4.1.3 library in `assets/vendor/mathjax/`.

## Reordering or hiding sections

Move objects in the `sections` array in `page.json`. Their array order is their
page order. For viewers first, followed by the introduction and notes:

```json
"sections": [
  { "id": "bird-example", "type": "viewer", "scene": "bird_flying" },
  { "id": "introduction", "type": "hero", "content": "content/introduction.md" },
  { "id": "about", "type": "note", "eyebrow": "Behind the scenes", "content": "content/notes.md" }
]
```

Use `"enabled": false` on a section to hide it, or remove its object. Each
section needs a unique `id` (letters, numbers and hyphens are a good choice).
Keep JSON strings in double quotes and avoid trailing commas.

The available section types are:

- `hero`: large centered title, author/date, and description. Set `"byline": false` to hide author/date.
- `viewer`: one side-by-side SVG/video pair, selected by its `scene` ID.
- `viewers`: optional group using a `scenes` list; older configurations still work.
- `note`: title at left, body at right; stacks on small screens.
- `text`: a single column for longer text.

To add a text section, create `content/method.md` with a heading and body, then
add this object anywhere in `sections`:

```json
{ "id": "method", "type": "text", "content": "content/method.md" }
```

An optional `eyebrow` supplies a small label above a text section's title.

## Calling individual viewers

Each scene in `scenes.json` describes one complete SVG/video viewer pair.
Use its `id` in a `viewer` section in `page.json`. Move that section object to
place the viewer anywhere among your Markdown sections:

```json
"sections": [
  { "id": "bird-example", "type": "viewer", "scene": "bird_flying" },
  { "id": "about", "type": "text", "content": "content/notes.md" },
  { "id": "splash-example", "type": "viewer", "scene": "pingpong_ball_cup_splash" }
]
```

Viewer text and assets belong to the scene. Placement and layout options
belong to its section in `page.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "bird_flying",
  "title": "Flying bird",
  "svgSource": "inputs/bird_flying.svg",
  "videoTitle": "Video viewer",
  "prompt": "What does this SVG look like from another angle?",
  "wandLabel": "Generate 3D",
  "aside": "Animated example",
  "numbering": true,
  "svg": "inputs/bird_flying.svg",
  "layers": "inputs/bird_flying",
  "videos": [
    { "src": "outputs/bird_flying_turntable.mp4", "title": "Novel View Synthesis", "subtitle": "Full Render" }
  ]
}
```

- `title`: heading above this viewer pair.
- `svgSource`: URL of the original SVG source, displayed as an “SVG source” link below the SVG viewer at the bottom right. Use an external URL or a path relative to this page; an empty string hides the link.
- `videoTitle`: label above the video canvas.
- `prompt`: question displayed inside this scene's video canvas before playback.
- `wandLabel`: the wand button's tooltip and accessible label.
- `aside`: small caption at the right of the scene heading; use `""` to hide it.
- `numbering`: use `false` to hide this scene's sequence number.

These properties are independent for every scene. Missing properties use
built-in defaults; an empty text string intentionally leaves that label blank.
Video entry titles/subtitles and optional playback rate/poster stay in `videos`.

Scene headings (`title`) and the video canvas label (`videoTitle`) support
inline Markdown and basic HTML formatting. For example, either of these works:

```json
"title": "On the left is a flying bird. *What if we view it from another angle?*"
```

```json
"title": "On the left is a flying bird. <i>What if we view it from another angle?</i>"
```

Use `**bold**` or `<strong>bold</strong>` for bold text. Formatting is sanitized;
scripts, event handlers, and inline CSS are removed. Prompts and other labels
remain plain text.

Use a unique scene `id` so references remain stable when you change an SVG
filename. If omitted, the ID defaults to the SVG filename without `.svg`;
repeated filenames automatically receive `-2`, `-3`, etc.

List a scene only once in the page. A grouped `viewers` section can still use
`"scenes": ["bird_flying", "pingpong_ball_cup_splash"]`, or omit `scenes` to
include all configured scenes. The group's viewers each use their own scene
properties; there is no shared `page.json.viewers` settings block.

## Swapping the SVG and video viewers

Set `"swapViewers": true` on a viewer section in `page.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "leaking-wine-animated-example",
  "type": "viewer",
  "scene": "leaking_wine_animated",
  "swapViewers": true
}
```

The video appears on the left and the SVG on the right. The first video loads
paused when the example approaches the viewport, with its title and previews
visible. The SVG and its layers load only after clicking the wand: the glow
sweeps across the SVG viewer for two seconds, then the artwork appears. The
scene's `prompt` appears in the waiting SVG viewer. The default `Generate 3D`
wand label becomes `View SVG`; a custom `wandLabel` is kept.

Video previews stay below the video, and the source link stays below the SVG. On small screens,
the video comes first, followed by the wand and SVG viewer. Set it to `false`
or omit it to keep the usual SVG-first layout. It also works on grouped
`viewers` sections, applying to each scene in that group.

## Changing assets and previewing

After changing `scenes.json` paths or re-exporting layers, run:

```sh
python3 prepare_viewer_assets.py
```

This reads `scenes.json`, indexes existing layer IDs/variants, and generates
video thumbnails/durations if ffmpeg/ffprobe are installed. Export filenames
remain `<stem>_layer<ID>[_normalized][variant suffix].svg`.

Preview through a web server rather than opening `index.html` as a `file://` URL:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. If that server is already running, just refresh.
Publish the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, `assets/`, and media files
together to GitHub Pages. Text/layout changes need only a refresh locally and
publishing the edited files for the live site.

Markdown rendering uses locally bundled [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)
and [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify); visitors need no CDN access.
Versions and license notices are retained in `assets/vendor/`.

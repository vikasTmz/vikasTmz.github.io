IR stereo camera pair is used, pseudorandom pattern projected, captures active illumination and passive light. Avoid matching occluded pixels (causes oversmoothing, edge fattening) New reconstruction loss based on LCN (local constrast normalization): removes low frequency components from passive IR re-calibrates the strength of active pattern locally to account for fading of patterns with distance.

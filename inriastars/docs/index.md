- Requested datasets
- Evaluation metrics
- ActiveStereoNet: End-to-End Seld-supervised Learning for Active Stereo Systems

	- precise depth with subpixel precision of 1/30th of a pixel.
	- does not suffer from over-smoothing issues
	- preserves edges
	- handles occlusions
	- robust to noise and texture-less patches
	- invariant to illumination changes.
	- IR stereo camera pair is used, pseudorandom pattern projected, captures active illumination and passive light.

	- Avoid matching occluded pixels (causes oversmoothing, edge fattening)
	- New reconstruction loss based on LCN (local constrast normalization):
		- removes low frequency components from passive IR
		- re-calibrates the strength of active pattern locally to account for fading of patterns with distance.
	- Window-based loss aggregation with adaptive weights for each pixel
		- increase discriminability and reduce the effect of local minima in the stereo cost function.
	- Detect and omit occluded pixels in the images during loss computations.

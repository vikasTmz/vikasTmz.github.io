# Datasets

There is currently no dataset available containing IR Dot Patterns (IDP) of human faces and their corresponding depth images.
There are several datasets containing RGB images and their corresponding depth images:

There are also 3D face datasets:
<add list>

Therefore a dataset of IR dot pattern face images has to be created.

## Synthetic Datasets: 

<Motivation for synthetic dataset>

- [✓] For importance of IR patterns : [Article](https://azttm.wordpress.com/2011/04/03/kinect-pattern-uncovered/) and [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328728)



- [ ] **Request other 3d face datasets** and apply Multilinear Model Learning on them.

- [ ] Use Diff. IR patterns
- [ ] Crop image using open CV. CromaKey for rgb images. (to be done when images are read for testing).
